4.Sheela has three things in her bag.She wants to compute the area of 3 things but 3 things are in different shapes .
The three things are in a square shape,rectangular shape,and circula shape respectively.
Write a program to help Sheela to calculate the area of different shapes.
Input format:
First output: side of a square in integer.
second input:length of a rectangle in integer.
Third input:breadth of a rectangle in integer.
fourth input:radius of a circle in double.

import java.util.*;
class Area{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the area of Square:");
        int side = scan.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Enter the length of Rectangle:");
        int length = scan.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Enter the breadth of Rectangle:");
        int breadth = scan.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Radius of circle:");
        double radius = scan.nextDouble();

        int area_square = side*side;
        int area_lb = length*breadth;
        double area_circle = 3.14*(radius*radius);
        {

        System.out.println(area_square);
        System.out.println(area_lb);
        System.out.println(area_circle);
                       }
                     }
                }
