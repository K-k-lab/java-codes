import java.util.*;
class hello{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scan.nextInt();
        int b = scan.nextInt();
        int c = a+b;
        int d = a-b;
        System.out.println("sum:" +c);
        System.out.println("difference:" +d);


    }
